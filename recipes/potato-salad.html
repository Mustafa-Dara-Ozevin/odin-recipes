    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Potatoes:</b> It's not potato salad without potatoes. The recipe doesn't specify what size potatoes or what kind, so choose medium-size potatoes, or enough to serve eight. As far as what kind of potatoes to use for potato salad, I'll cover that in the next section.</li>
        <li><b>Eggs:</b> Hard-boiled eggs are a must-have for this kind of old-fashioned potato salad, but you can leave them out if you really want to.</li>
        <li><b>Celery:</b> Celery adds a crunchy element to balance the softer texture and creaminess of the potatoes.</li>
        <li><b>Onions:</b> You can use any onion you like, including yellow, white, or red onions. Chop the onion into small, uniform pieces so no one bites into a big chunk of raw onion.</li>
        <li><b>Relish:</b> Use your favorite sweet pickle relish. Some reviewers chopped up sweet gherkin pickles, or substitute relish or pickles that are less sweet.</li>
        <li><b>Mayonnaise:</b>  This is the creamy element that brings all the ingredients together. For best results, mix the mayonnaise, mustard, relish, and seasonings together in a separate bowl. Give it a taste test and adjust the seasonings before adding to the potatoes, eggs, and onion.</li>
        <li><b>Mustard:</b> Use your favorite mustard. Some reviewers like to use yellow mustard and some prefer Dijon.</li>
        <li><b>Seasonings:</b> This recipe calls for garlic salt, celery salt, and ground black pepper to taste; some reviewers added extras like paprika and garlic powder. You can add minced herbs, too, like dill, chives, parsley, and tarragon.</li>
    </ul>
